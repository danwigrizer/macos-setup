## Disk encryption

<mark>You must encrypt your disk</mark>. 

Do it with Apple's tools right at the beginning of your fresh installation process.


## macOS System Settings

### `Security & Privacy`
- `General`: use Apple Watch to unlock stuff, require password after `5` minutes, allow apps downloads from `App Store and identified developers`
- `FileVault`: should be on (you must have turned it on during macOS installation)
- `Firewall`: turn it on
- Then, click on `Advanced...`, turn `Stealth Mode` on and uncheck all other options (we will selectively accept a few apps to connect with the outside world).
- `Privacy`: allow `iTerm2` and `Code` to have `Full Disk Access`

### `Sharing`
- Change computer name to `WHATEVER_YOU_WANT`
- Make sure all sharing options are disabled (you most likely don't need any of them)
