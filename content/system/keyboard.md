# macOS System Settings

`Keyboard`
- `Shortcuts`: add Switch to `Space #` using `OPTION + #`
- `Text`: disable `Correct spelling automatically`, `Capitalize words automatically`, `Add period with double-space`, `Use smart quotes and dashes`
- `Input Sources`: delete other languages and leave only `Brazilian - Pro` (`ABC` is not enough to have `ç` `à` etc)

If you type on other Non-English languages, you may also want to use [Ukelele](https://software.sil.org/ukelele/) to edit your keyboard layout. For an example, see: https://samuelmeuli.com/blog/2019-11-17-removing-dead-keys-on-macos/.
