# Wolfram Language

In May 2019, Wolfram Research made their language accessible for all developers:

> We’re releasing today the Free Wolfram Engine for Developers. It’s a full engine for the Wolfram Language, that can be deployed on any system—and called from programs, languages, web servers, or anything.

For more details, read their [announcement post](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2019/05/launching-today-free-wolfram-engine-for-developers/). 

But please also make sure you understand the caveats and limitations involved. Here are their [FAQ](https://www.wolfram.com/engine/faq/) and their [license terms](https://www.wolfram.com/legal/terms/wolfram-engine.html).
