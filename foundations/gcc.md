# `gcc`

Several languages libraries depend on gcc. 

The GNU Compiler Collection includes front ends for C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Ada, Go, and D, as well as libraries for these languages (libstdc++, ...). See [https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gcc](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gcc).

```zsh
brew update && brew install gcc
```

As of `2020-05-29`, the installed version was `9.3.0_1`, its exact `brew` formula is [here](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/566560476be4973d396c54e920411b07081b6722/Formula/gcc.rb).
